### Built With

To create this application, I used:

* React => It is a library for web and native user interfaces.
* NodeJs => It is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* ExpressJs => It is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications.
* Cors => It is a middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in your Node.js server.
* Axios => It is a popular HTTP client for making API requests.
* Nodemon => A development tool that automatically restarts the server when code changes are detected.
* ChatEngine.io => It is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of adding chat functionality to Node.js and React applications. In this project, we will create a ChatEngine project to manage user data and enable chat interactions via its API.
* MultiChatSocket: It is a WebSocket that allows users to connect to all their chats.
* MultiChatWindow: It is the user interface for typing and viewing messages.
* useMultiChatLogic: It is a set of hooks and functions for state management and API calls, essential for the chat app's functionality.
